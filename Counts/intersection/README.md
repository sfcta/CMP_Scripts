For each new CMP cycle:

1. Parse out totals:
  1. Add the appropriate command/arguments to `parse_intersection_totals.ps1`
  2. Run the script
  3. Comment out the current cycle's command, save, and commit
2. Amend and run `compare_years.ipynb` to generate charts for comparison and for the CMP report.
